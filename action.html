        <p>One of the primary ways you can take action is to start paying careful attention to the products you use (particularly those that are used once and immediately discarded), where they come from, and how they are made. Most of us know about how harmful single-use, non-biodegradable plastic is for the environment. But did you know that due to the harmful practices used by their manufacturers, tissue products like Kleenex, paper towels, and toilet paper are in great part responsible for the destruction of Canada’s boreal forests? By following the mantra of “Reduce, reuse, and recycle”, looking for more sustainably-sourced brands, and prioritizing durability over cheapness in products like clothing, you can reduce the toll your consumption takes on the wilderness. And of course, any step you take to reduce your carbon footprint, like carpooling when possible or turning to a more vegetarian diet, is equally valuable. No matter how small it seems, make one change to your lifestyle in the right direction, and that change will help you fight climate change and pave the way to a world of greater environmental consciousness and sustainability. That change matters.</p>
