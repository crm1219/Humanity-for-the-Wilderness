      <p id="intro">The United States' Wilderness Act of 1964 defines wilderness as "an area where the earth and community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." Some of America's wilderness is protected under its statutes, but far too much is left still vulnerable to the threats of development and destruction. Join the fight to protect this essential part of our world and preserve its beauty for ourselves and all those to come after us.</p>

And the home of the wolf shall be my home,<br>
And a bunch of bones on the boundless snows<br>
The end of my trail . . . who knows, who knows!”<br></br> - Robert William Service, “The Nostomaniac”, Rhymes of a Rolling Stone, 1912
