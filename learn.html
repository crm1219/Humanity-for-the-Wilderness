          <h2>The Danger</h2>
          <p>In the United States, lands designated as official wilderness through the 1964 Wilderness Act receive the highest amount of land protection from the government, ensuring they will be safeguarded against the damage dealt by development and industrial exploitation. Yet beyond this less than five percent of all land in the U.S., the unprotected wildlands are shrinking every day. This loss can no longer be dismissed as the cost we pay for progress when it has become increasingly clear that the very air we breathe and water we drink depend upon the existence of wilderness.</p>

          <h2>Protection Under Law</h2>
          <p>The strongest protection America’s public lands can receive is if Congress expands the lands marked as official wilderness under the Wilderness Act, but other forms of protection are also valuable, such as designating them national parks, forests, or monuments. Laws should also work toward environmental justice by shifting land rights away from industries and toward indigenous communities.

          <h2>Abandoning Fossil Fuels</h2>
          <p>Shifting away from fossil fuels to sources of clean energy that don’t harm ecosystems is necessary to both protect public lands from being degraded by companies’ extraction of coal, oil, and gas, and to reduce the pollution that, by contributing to climate change, threatens wildlife, ecosystems, and the entire world. </p>

          <h2>Cultivating Appreciation and Access</h2>
          <p>Many people, particularly low income and minority communities, face barriers to accessing nature and the significant mental and physical health benefits it provides. Access to nature should be recognized as a human right, whether it comes in the form of a true wilderness or an urban wilderness. Moreover, strengthening the connection between humans and nature will benefit both, for once people can reap the benefits of the outdoors, they will be more likely to recognize and appreciate the necessity of preserving wilderness in all its forms. </p>
